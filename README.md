## Vision

**For** the FLL Igualada organizers, volunteers, and participants **who** need to efficiently manage the competition logistics and track real-time progress, **the project** FLL Backend **is an** event management and scoring system **that** allows for seamless coordination of teams, judges, matches, and multimedia content. **Unlike** manual tracking methods, our system enforces specific FLL rules (such as unique matchmaking constraints), validates volunteer roles, and provides an engaging, mobile-accessible experience for the community.
